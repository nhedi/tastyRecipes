        <p>These pancakes are light and fluffy and made completely from scratch. <br/> They’re not too sweet and are scented with vanilla, making them extra delicious.<br/> These are easy to adapt — try adding a handful of berries, nuts or chocolate to the batter.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients, 4 servings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (295 ml) milk, dairy and non-dairy both will work</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more for skillet</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder and the salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Warm milk in microwave or on top of stove until lukewarm, not hot (you should be able to keep your finger submerged for 10 seconds). Whisk milk, egg, melted butter and the vanilla extract until combined. (By warming the milk slightly, the melted butter mixes into the milk instead of turning into small lumps).</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet (or use griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when you splatter a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the pan and eventually evaporates.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour milk mixture into the well and use a fork to stir until you no longer see clumps of flour. It is okay if the batter has small lumps, in fact you want that – it is important not to over-mix the batter.Lightly brush skillet with melted butter. Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto skillet. Gently spread the batter into a 4-inch circle.</li>
            <li>When edges look dry and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces of the pancake, turn over. This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter and/or berries.</li>
